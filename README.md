# Dynamic Range Compression Optimization for Hearing Aids in Noisy Environments

## Abstract

Dynamic range compression (DRC) is a pivotal algorithm utilized in modern hearing aids to amplify quiet sounds while reducing loud sounds, thereby enhancing the listening experience for individuals with hearing loss. However, the effectiveness of DRC diminishes in noisy environments, where distortion and amplified background noise can impede speech understanding. This research endeavors to explore the constraints of DRC in noisy settings and propose innovative strategies to optimize dynamic range control through signal processing theory. By employing mathematical models and analyzing compression effects on combinations of multiple sounds, this study seeks to ameliorate hearing aid performance in challenging auditory conditions.
